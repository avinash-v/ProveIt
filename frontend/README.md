# ProveIt Angular Frontend

Clone this repository and run `npm i` to install the dependencies. 

To use this code effectively, use [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) as it works much better and is easier to link. 

Nebular icons may not be installed even after running `npm i`, to make sure it installs it , run `npm i nebular-icons`. 

In case of troubles using this in Linux, remove the node_modules folder and run the `npm install` command to install os dependent dependencies for this project.

Right now, please make components under the main module by running `cd src/app/main`. This puts you inside the main module. Then components, services or new modules itself can be made using the Angular CLI.
